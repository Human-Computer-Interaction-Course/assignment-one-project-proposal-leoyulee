                    <p>This website is made for the developers working on the project in order to promote uniformity within the whole process. Developers are assumed to have knowledge in the overall roblox development jargon and terms in their respective field. If the audience were to come to this website, they would be looking for resources on how they would accomplish a task or how a present system works.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>For the site that this site will be based on, I picked the ROBLOX wiki articles. The reason for this is they provide a good separation between each category of documentation, and further intuitive design that allows users to quickly find what they're looking for. Plus, the uniformity of the site allows its audience to interpret the content quicker every visit.</p>
