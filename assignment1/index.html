                    <p>For the site that this site will be based on, I picked the ROBLOX wiki articles. The reason for this is they provide a good separation between each category of documentation, and further intuitive design that allows users to quickly find what they're looking for. Plus, the uniformity of the site allows its audience to interpret the content quicker every visit.</p>
